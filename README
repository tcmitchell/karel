This is version 1.0 of an interpreter for Karel's programming language as
described in "Karel the Robot" by Richard E. Pattis (John Wiley & Sons, 1981).
The language is described as a "gentle introduction to Pascal"; while very
simple, it teaches the basics of structured programming.
N.B.  This is *not* the interpreter that Pattis wrote (the one described in the
book), which is copyright.  This version was written independently; approval
was obtained from him for this posting.  Right is hereby given for unlimited
non-profit use of this particular package.

The structure of this interpreter is based heavily on that of hoc(1), described
in "The Unix Programming Environment" by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike; anyone
interested in the "guts" of this program should be familiar with that program.
