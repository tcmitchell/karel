Richard E. Pattis wrote the book "Karel the Robot", (John Wiley &
Sons, 1981) which describes Karel and his world.  This work is based
on that book.

Jan Miksovsky is the original author of this code, circa 1985.

Tom Mitchell <tmitchel@users.sourceforge.net> modified that code in
the Spring of 2000 to be more modular, and to split the core engine
out from the curses user interface.  This allowed the GTK interface to
be added.
