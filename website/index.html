<h1>Karel The Robot</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<em>Karel The Robot</em> is a robot simulator that affords a gentle
introduction to computer programming.  Users write Karel programs and
feed them to the simulator to watch them execute.  Karel's programming
language is similar to Pascal.
<p>
The definitive reference for Karel the Robot is the book <i>Karel the
Robot: A Gentle Introduction to The Art of Programming</i> by Richard
E. Pattis, Jim Roberts and Mark Stehlik (ISBN: 0471597252).
<p>
At the moment, Karel should run on most Unix based systems.  There is
a GUI that uses GTK, and there is a curses interface.  It is built
with GNU automake/autoconf, so the standard configure; make
instructions apply.

<h2>Downloads</h2>
To download the karel distribution please visit the
<a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=8696>
downloads page</a>.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
The documentation is written in GNU Texinfo, and thus is available
here as:
<ul>
<li><a href=doc/html_mono/karel.html>HTML</a> entirely on one web page.
<li><a href=doc/html_chapter/karel_toc.html>HTML</a> with one web page
per chapter.
<li><a href=doc/html_node/karel_toc.html>HTML</a> with one web page
per node.
<li>A <a href=doc/karel.ps>PostScript</a> file.
<li>A <a href=doc/karel.pdf>PDF</a> file.
</ul>

<h2>What's Next</h2>
It would be nice to get a Microsoft Windows GUI going so that kids
with PCs available can learn to program Karel.  Unfortunately I don't
know much about programming Microsoft Windows.
<p>
And it would be great to improve the GTK interface so that it has a
code stepper.
<p>
And it would be nice to have a world editor so that user's can create
worlds graphically instead of typing in a text file.

<h2>Thanks</h2>
Thanks go to Richard Pattis and Jan Miksovsky.  Richard Pattis wrote
the book, and Jan Miksovsky wrote the original version of this
software.  See the documentation for more 
<a href=http://karel.sourceforge.net/doc/html_node/karel_5.html>
details</a>.
<p>
And a great big <b><i>thank you</i></b> goes out to the SourceForge
folks for making all this possible.
